# demo_app

This is the complete source code for my demo app for the completion od engage workshop project.

INTRO:

I have used the face recognition tech for the hospitality sector. As we know that their topmost priority is to provide their customers the best in class service. So with this app they identify the customer by their face which means they can identify them when they enter the hotel premises and arrange a specialised greetings for them according to the preferences and habits of the customers which we will be storing in the database of our application, this database is generated in our local system by the application. This tech have many more potential features in this app which can be added in future, like for privacy and security face authentication is a very reliable option.
